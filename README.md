# Weather34 skin for WeeWX
Weather Station website skin with Live Data for WeeWX. This version is compatible with WeeWX 4.x.x builds / Python 2.7 and Python 3.x. **Please note, some functionality will be lost if you are not using WeeWX 4.1.1 and its default extended database.** It is therefore strongly recommended that you start with an entirely new clean Python3 install of WeeWX 4.1.1.

Version W34-HC-IMJD-4.0.0

Packaged for installation using its own unique installer and an online pre-installation settings form https://steepleian.github.io/weewx-Weather34

This repository contains the WeeWX version of Brian Underdown's Weather34 website template set. Brian's main website is https://weather34.com/homeweatherstation/index.html In January, 2019, Brian asked others to take over the distribution/maintainence of his design whilst he concentrated on development only for MB NanoSD, called Weather34 MB-SMART. This WeeWX version of the template is actively developed by Ian Millard and Jerry Dietrich.

This version requires WeeWX version 4.1.1 or later software. WeeWX is available at http://weewx.com

This version is designed explicitly to harness the powerful WeeWX database to generate the weather data charts and statistical data. It was originally built on the current MB-UB40-IHVN which is now maintained by Lightmaster (Meteobridge-Weather34-Template). Although we maintain a similar look and feel with MB-UB40-IHVN,the weewx-Weather34 now has many unique features.

This version is assembled as an install package and uses its own unique utility, w34_installer.py, to install. This greatly simplifies the installation process from that of previous versions. Depending on your own WeeWX setup, minor edits may be required to be made to weewx.conf and Weather34 skin.conf files. Please see the Weather34 skin Installation Guide for detailed instructions.

# What's New in this Version W34-HC-IMJD-4.0.0

**Please Note.** The appearance and features of this new version are identical to those of the previous version (W34-HC-IMJD-3.0.0). The new changes relate to moving some of the settings from the skin's PHP coding into its core Python Module, weather34.py. If you are currently using W34-HC-IMJD-3.0.0 and you are happy that you have a stable setup, it is not absolutely necessary to upgrade.

There has been even more rationalisation of the setup process. The pre-install settings page at https://steepleian.github.io/weewx-Weather34/ has been simplified. It is no longer required to specify the path/filename for the json data files generated by web services. These are generated automatically using the two character code for each web service as the filename and are placed in the jsondata folder. When you have completed the settings form a file 'services.txt' is automatically downloaded to your default Download folder. This file should then be copied to your install folder prior to running the unique installer. When the install process is exectuted, the data contained in services.txt is used to populate weewx.conf

In certain circumstances a memorary leak had been identified for setups using Python2. This has now been rectified with an update to the weather34.py module.

The installer now defaults to overwrite mode, settings1.php will not be overwritten as it does not exist in the package. However, it is essential that any customisations you may have been made are backed up before running the install.

kPa has been introduced as a pressure unit for Canadian users.

# Setup

**If you are upgrading from a previous version of this skin, due to the significant changes, you must recreate your settings!.php file by running the full install process. Just copying your previous settings1.php will cause errors which are then difficult to resolve.**

Follow the instructions in the 'installation guide' (INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) to install the template.
Browse to http://your/path/to/weewx/weather34/easyW34skinSetup.php
There is no initial password when the page prompts the first time -- just press LOGIN to enter the page.
IMPORTANT set a password in the screen for future use -- your browser can remember it. This will make future updates    reasonably secure so only you can do the updates to the configuration.
Make setting entries in the easyweathersetup.php page and SAVE. The next time you run it, use the password you set in the step above.
Repeat running easyW34skinSetup.php until the main screen appears as you like it.

# Credits for this version

Apart from Brian Underdown without him, this template would never exist, I would aslo like to acknowledge the following people: -

Jerry Dietrich for his massive contribution in converting my wild ideas into reality, putting me straight on my mediocre coding skills and having the patience of a dozen saints.

Gary Roderick for his original coding of Highcharts for WeeWX.

William Bailey aka Lightmaster who maitains the MB version of Weather34. Incredibly helpful and always on the end of Telegram when I need a chat, night or day.

Ken True for sharing files and who makes my job of maintaining the WeeWX version so much easier.

Thomas Sosio for his invaluable contribution in producing the Meteobridge lookup code to translate WeeWX database output.

David Marshall for contributing technical knowledge and solutions to create some original .tmpl files and alternative solutions for weather alerts.

Taylormia for contributing his excellent setup example for instances where WeeWX and server/template are remote to each other.

Gary Portellas for a helpful suggestion to further simplify the installation process.

Drealine for his recent work on extending the French translations.

All those unamed people who have helped me with testing updates.

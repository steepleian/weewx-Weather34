# Weather34 skin for WeeWX
Weather Station website skin with Live Data for WeeWX. This version is compatible with WeeWX 4.x.x builds / Python 2.7 and Python 3.x. **This version of the template requires either the extended database schema introduced with WeeWX 4.0.0 or one that has been manually extended to included fields for lightning data.** It is strongly recommended that you start with an entirely new clean Python3 install of WeeWX 4.4.0 or later.

Version W34-HC-IMJD-4.2.0

Packaged for installation using its own unique installer and an online pre-installation settings form https://steepleian.github.io/weewx-Weather34

This repository contains the WeeWX version of Brian Underdown's Weather34 website template set. Brian's main website is https://weather34.com/homeweatherstation/index.html In January, 2019, Brian asked others to take over the distribution/maintainence of his design whilst he concentrated on development only for MB NanoSD, called Weather34 MB-SMART. This WeeWX version of the template is actively developed by Ian Millard and Jerry Dietrich.

The repository contains a main and development branch. To maintain integrity of the main branch, all pull request must be made via the development branch. 

This version requires WeeWX version 4.1.1 or later software. WeeWX is available at http://weewx.com. It is PHP 8 compatible.

This version is designed explicitly to harness the powerful WeeWX database to generate the weather data charts and statistical data. It was originally built on the current MB-UB40-IHVN which is now maintained by Lightmaster (Meteobridge-Weather34-Template). Although we maintain a similar look and feel with MB-UB40-IHVN,the weewx-Weather34 now has many unique features.

This version is assembled as an install package and uses its own unique installer and un-installer utilities. This greatly simplifies the installation process from that of previous versions. Depending on your own WeeWX setup, minor edits may be required to be made to weewx.conf and Weather34 skin.conf files. Please see the Weather34 skin Installation Guide for detailed instructions.

# What's New in this Version W34-HC-IMJD-4.2.0

**Please Note.** The appearance and features of this new version are identical to those of the previous version (W34-HC-IMJD-3.0.0). The new changes relate to moving some of the settings from the skin's PHP coding into its core Python Module, weather34.py. If you are currently using W34-HC-IMJD-3.0.0 and you are happy that you have a stable setup, it is not absolutely necessary to upgrade.

The skin/template is now PHP 8 compatible.

There has been even more rationalisation of the setup process. The pre-install settings page at https://steepleian.github.io/weewx-Weather34/ has been simplified. It is no longer required to specify the path/filename for the json data files generated by web services. These are generated automatically using the two character code for each web service as the filename and are placed in the jsondata folder. When you have completed the pre-install settings form a file 'services.txt' is automatically downloaded, which to your default Download folder. This file should then be copied to your install folder of the device are going to use Weather34 skin prior to running the unique installer. When the install process is exectuted, the data contained in services.txt is used to populate weewx.conf

Theme switching has been removed completely from the settings page. Choice of theme is made exclusively from the UI Theme button on the menu. This toggles between Dark and Light. The chart theme is also now syncronised to page theme.

In certain circumstances a memorary leak had been identified for setups using Python2. This has now been rectified with an update to the weather34.py module.

The installer now defaults to overwrite mode, settings1.php will not be overwritten as it does not exist in the package. However, it is essential that any customisations you may have been made are backed up before running the install.

kPa has been introduced as a pressure unit for Canadian users.

Introduction of a 'set and forget' module for the automatic daily update of multiple database files. More details in the installation guide.

Optional enhancement to web services which converts RSS XML feeds into json data. Requires the Python xmltodict library to be installed.

For UK users only. Option to select UK severe weather warning regions. This is an alternative to Meteoalarm which is currently not supporting The UK (temporarily?).

# Setup

**If you are upgrading from a previous version of this skin, due to the significant changes, you must recreate your settings1.php file by running the full install process. Just copying your previous settings1.php will cause errors which are then more difficult to resolve.**

Follow the instructions in the 'installation guide' (INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) to install the template.
Browse to http://your/path/to/weewx/weather34/easyW34skinSetup.php
There is no initial password when the page prompts the first time -- just press LOGIN to enter the page.
IMPORTANT set a password in the screen for future use -- your browser can remember it. This will make future updates    reasonably secure so only you can do the updates to the configuration.
Make setting entries in the easyweathersetup.php page and SAVE. The next time you run it, use the password you set in the step above.
Repeat running easyW34skinSetup.php until the main screen appears as you like it.

# Credits for this version
